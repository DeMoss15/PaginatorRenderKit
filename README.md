# PaginatorRenderKit

Paginator Render Kit is a set of abstractions to simplify and speed up implementation of paginatable lists with different view types.

The library is based on solutions developed by:
* Konstantin Tskhovrebov aka terrakok, see [source code](https://gitlab.com/terrakok/gitlab-client) of the GitFox client and his [standup at Yandex Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5afEeuI0GQ) about Paginator itself
* Hannes Dorfmann aka sockeqwe, see [the Adapter Delegates library](https://github.com/sockeqwe/AdapterDelegates) and [his article about the library](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/adapter-delegates)
